# Neighborly

## What this does:
This app is a social online community for tenants of a specific building or community.

## How the code works:
The app uses Node, React, Mongo for the database, Bootstrap for styling, auth0 for user authentication and Cloudinary for storing images. It also utilizes GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data from the database.

## How to run the app/deployed version:
https://app-neighborly.herokuapp.com/
- At the main screen, sign up with a new account if new to the site (or log in if you have an account).
- If this is the first time you have logged in, the next page will ask you to fill in details for your profile. Once you fill in those details, you will be taken to the posts page.
- If you have logged in before, the next page will be the posts page.
- On the posts page, you can view your profile, add a post and view other posts.
- Your post will display as soon as you submit it, with your name, profile picture, how long ago you posted it and the title and comment of the post.
